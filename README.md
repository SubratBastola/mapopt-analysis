# mapopt-analysis
A modular, GUI-based Python toolkit to compute optimal MAP using cerebral autoregulation indices (COx), designed to assist in predicting neurological outcomes following cardiac arrest.

This project implements multi-window COx analysis and MAPopt estimation based on cerebral oximetry data. It supports batch processing, spike filtering, and burden analysis to quantify deviations from optimal MAP. Developed for translational neurocritical care research.
